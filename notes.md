Not sure if this is how you make a markdown file, but we're going to try. It didn't really explain that or i don't remember it.
I dont retain a lot of info from reading "dry" things for some reason... ask me about a boss fight in FFXIV and i can seem to recall every part of the fight, especially while doing it, but also before hand.
My recall ability is just keyed into the wrong things. I'll get more used to this as we use it. I also have a friend who's job is to basically use GitHub to handle requests and manage a production environ.
I'm sure you dont need or want this to be super long so i'll stop. But I feel like most confusion I or others might have will be cleared up as we roll up our sleeves and play with GitHub more.
